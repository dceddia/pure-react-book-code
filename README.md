# Pure React Exercises + Examples

These are the Exercises and Examples that accompany the [Pure React book](https://purereact.com).

The **Examples** folder contains the code for every major example in the book. If you get stuck, or if you REALLY don't want to type out the code, look in here. I really recommend typing out the code though, it will stick in your head much better that way.

The **Exercises** folder contains solutions to the exercises. They're organized by chapter (not every chapter has accompanying exercises). Don't worry if your solution doesn't match mine exactly!

Every one of the examples and exercises is executable. Inside an example's directory, run `yarn` (or `npm install`), (maybe go get a coffee), and when that's done run `yarn start` (or `npm start`). Each one of them was generated using the `create-react-app` tool used throughout the book.

If you don't want to wait for `npm install` for every exercise, feel free to move or copy the `node_modules` directory between exercises. Only a few of them use additional packages (if you see errors, just run "npm install").

NOTE: if you copy the `node_modules` directory on Mac or Linux, use the command `cp -a` instead of `cp -r`. Due to the way NPM uses symlinks, using `-r` might result in `npm start` failing to run.

Enjoy your journey through learning React!
